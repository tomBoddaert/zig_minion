# zig_minion

### This is a zig implementation of my variant of the Little Minion Computer.
The [Little Minion Computer](https://mjrbordewich.webspace.durham.ac.uk/lmc/) model was created by [Professor Magnus Bordewich](https://mjrbordewich.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) of [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/homepage/), based on the [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) created by [Dr. Stuart Madnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Madnick) of [M.I.T.](https://www.mit.edu/) in 1965.

For a more featureful and better written implementation, see my [LMinC](https://github.com/tomBoddaert/lminc) project, which is written in Rust.
